# stocks-analysis
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an analysis of the entire stock market by refactoring code for Steve. Steve initially wanted to look into a dozen stocks as reference for his parents who are interested in making an investment. The original code worked well for Steve and made it easier for him to navigate the given stocks. However, Steve would like to continue to research more stocks for his parents and wants to have the dataset incoporate the entire stock matket.

## Results

After refactoring the script in VBA the stock performance was significantly better than the performance of 2018. The majority of stocks that year had a greater total volume which indicates how often a stock was shared. We can also look at the percentage of yearly returns to see if the price increased or decreased, and looking at the dataset we can conclude that the majority of the stocks in 2017 had a increase in price.

## Summary
### Pros of Refactoring code:
### Advantages of Refactoring code:
Refactoring code could be an advantage by reducing the steps taken within the code which will make it less time consuming. Another advantage of refactoring code could be making the code more organized which could also make it easier for others to read. 
### Disadvantages of Refactoring code:
The main disadvantage of refactoring code would be overlooking simple mistakes due to the function of the code not changing. This could also lead to it being a time consuming task because the mistake could be a missing text that was overlooked.
### Advantages of the orginal & refactored VBA script:
The advantage of the original VBA script was the amount of stocks that were used. There were only twelve stocks that were used in the original script which made the coding process slightly easier. The orginal script always had...
The advantage of the refactored VBA Code was that there was a broader dataset but it took less time to analyse. Looping through the larger dataset could have been more difficult due to the data size but because of nested looping it much easier to execute.
### Disadvantages of the orginal & refactored VBA script:
-Detailed statement on the advanteges & disadvanteges of the original and refactored VBA script(code).
The disadvantage of the original VBA script was the fact that it was solely focused on a small bit of information.
A disadvantage of the refactored VBA script was that there was an increase in information needed inorder for VBA to specifically operate in the way we needed it too. The nested looping in an example of taking an extra step to insure VBA included the additional information.
